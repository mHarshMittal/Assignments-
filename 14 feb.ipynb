    "1. What is Multithreading in Python?\n",
    "Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads run concurrently within a single process. This allows for parallel execution of tasks, making programs more efficient, especially for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for: Improving performance by running multiple operations simultaneously, such as handling multiple network requests or performing background tasks while the main program continues running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module: Python's threading module is used to handle threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why threading module? It provides a higher-level interface for working with threads compared to the lower-level thread module. It simplifies thread management and synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Functions in the threading Module\n",
    "activeCount(): Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "currentThread(): Returns the current Thread object, corresponding to the caller's thread of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "enumerate(): Returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Thread Functions Explained\n",
    "run(): This method represents the thread's activity. It is called when you start a thread with start(). By default, it does nothing, but you can override it in a subclass of Thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "start(): Begins the thread's activity. It will call the run() method in a new thread of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "join(): Blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join() method is called terminates. Useful for waiting until a thread has completed its task.\n",
    "\n",
    "isAlive(): Checks if the thread is still alive. Returns True if the thread is still running, False otherwise."
