    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain Non-relational Databases in Short. In Which Scenarios is MongoDB Preferred Over SQL Databases?\n",
    "MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents.\n",
    "Non-relational Databases: Store data in various formats (e.g., documents, key-value pairs) without a fixed schema.\n",
    "Preferred When: Schema flexibility is needed, handling large volumes of diverse data, or high performance is crucial.\n",
    "Q2. State and Explain the Features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Document-oriented: Stores data as JSON-like documents.\n",
    "Flexible Schema: No fixed structure; data can vary.\n",
    "Scalable: Supports horizontal scaling.\n",
    "High Performance: Fast read and write operations.\n",
    "Replication: Data redundancy with replica sets.\n",
    "Indexing: Fast queries with various indexing options.\n",
    "Aggregation: Advanced data processing capabilities.\n",
    "Q3. Write a Code to Connect MongoDB to Python. Also, Create a Database and a Collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "Connect to MongoDB: Use MongoClient from the pymongo library.\n",
    "Create Database and Collection: Access or create a database and collection by referencing them through the MongoClient connection.\n",
    "Q4. Using the Database and Collection Created in Question Number 3, Write a Code to Insert One Record and Insert Many Records. Use the find() and find_one() Methods to Print the Inserted Record.\n",
    "Insert Records: Use insert_one() to add a single document and insert_many() for multiple documents.\n",
    "Retrieve Records: Use find_one() to get a single document and find() to retrieve multiple documents.\n",
    "Q5. Explain How You Can Use the find() Method to Query the MongoDB Database. Write a Simple Code to Demonstrate This.\n",
    "find() Method: Retrieves documents that match the query criteria.\n",
    "Q6. Explain the sort() Method. Give an Example to Demonstrate Sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "sort() Method: Orders the query results by specified fields in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "Q7. Explain Why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() are Used.\n",
    "delete_one(): Removes a single document that matches the query.\n",
    "delete_many(): Removes multiple documents that match the query.\n",
    "drop(): Deletes the entire collection, including all documents."
