    "### Q1: What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    "\n",
    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "1. **Mean**: The average of all data points.\n",
    "2. **Median**: The middle value when data points are sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "3. **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: Difference between Mean, Median, and Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean**: Calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values. It provides a measure of the \"center\" of the data but can be affected by outliers.\n",
    "- **Median**: The middle value when the dataset is ordered. It is less affected by outliers and skewed data, giving a better measure of central location in such cases.\n",
    "- **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently. It is useful for categorical data and can have multiple modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Measures of Central Tendency for the Given Height Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data: `[178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean**:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{data}}{\\text{number of data points}} = \\frac{178 + 177 + 176 + 177 + 178.2 + 178 + 175 + 179 + 180 + 175 + 178.9 + 176.2 + 177 + 172.5 + 178 + 176.5}{16} \\approx 177.31\n",

    "\n",
    "**Mode**:\n",
    "The value that appears most frequently is 177, so the mode is 177.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Standard Deviation for the Given Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\text{mean})^2}{n - 1}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the given data:\n",
    "Mean = 177.31\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate variance:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Variance} = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - 177.31)^2}{15} \\approx 5.24\n",
    "\\]\n",

    "Standard deviation:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{5.24} \\approx 2.29\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Range**: Difference between the maximum and minimum values. It shows the span of the dataset.\n",
    "**Variance**: Average of the squared differences from the mean. It quantifies the spread of the data.\n",
    "**Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance. It gives the average distance of data points from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "For dataset `[10, 12, 23, 23, 16, 23, 21, 16]`:\n",
    "- Range = 23 - 10 = 13\n",
    "- Variance = \\(\\frac{((10-18.125)^2 + (12-18.125)^2 + \\ldots)}{7} = 20.3\\)\n",
    "- Standard Deviation = \\(\\sqrt{20.3} \\approx 4.51\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: What is a Venn Diagram?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Venn diagram is a graphical representation of sets and their relationships. It uses overlapping circles to show how different sets intersect, union, or complement each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Given sets:\n",
    "- \\( A = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\} \\)\n",

    "### Q8: What is Skewness in Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution of data around its mean. Positive skew (right-skewed) indicates a longer right tail, while negative skew (left-skewed) indicates a longer left tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9: Position of Median in Right-Skewed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In right-skewed data, the median is typically less than the mean. The mean is pulled towards the right tail, making it greater than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10: Covariance vs. Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Covariance**: Measures how two variables change together. Positive covariance indicates they move in the same direction, while negative indicates opposite directions.\n",
    "- **Correlation**: Normalized form of covariance that measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q11: Formula for Sample Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",

    "### Q12: Measures of Central Tendency in Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",

    "### Q13: Covariance vs. Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covariance**:\n",
    "- Measures direction of relationship.\n",
    "- Units are the product of the units of the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation**:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Mean**: Outliers can skew the mean significantly.\n",
    "**Median**: Less affected by outliers, remains more stable.\n",
    "**Standard Deviation**: Outliers increase variance and standard deviation.\n",
